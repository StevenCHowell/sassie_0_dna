This free software is written by Lin Yang for users at beamline X9 of NSLS. Use at your own risk.
Thanks to Kevin Yager and Ian Berke for suggestions and bug fixes.

(1) This package depends on the following software packages:

	python
	numpy
	python image library (PIL)
	matplotlib
	scipy (for line profile extraction)
	SWIG (for compiling the RQconv module)
	pygtk (for the solution scattering GUI only)

(2) This package also include a C program that needs to be compiled for your particular OS. 
Simply type the following under the directory pyXS:

	python setup.py build_ext --inplace

or using mingw under windows:

	python setup.py build_ext --inplace --compile=mingw32

This should generate a new file _RQconv.so (_RQconv.pyd under Windows). 

NOTE: compiling using gcc-4 might not work under windows (python is compiled using gcc-3?)
The solution is to edit Lib\distutils\cygwinccompiler.py under the python directory
and remove the -mno-cygwin flag manually.

(3) Older versions of PIL have problem correctly reading TIFF files that have Big Endian byte 
order. You will know if your scattering data appear scrambled. Update PIL.

(4) The binaries are generated using Python 2.7.
