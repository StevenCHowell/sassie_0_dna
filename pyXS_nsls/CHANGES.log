Winter 2009

Intial code

Summer 2010

1. Data2D.merge()
2. handling of mask since data collected by the PILATUS detector may
contain zero intensity 

Spring 2011

1. updated calculations for q - pixel position conversion 
2. labels on figures 
3. ExpPara.flip for WAXS data
4. revised code for Data2d mask, based on suggestions by Kevin Yager. 
5. Major revision in handling of solution scattering data. Subtract dark
current before azimuthal average. Scale and merge SAXS/WAXS before buffer
scattering subtraction. Partly based on suggestions by Ian Berke.
6. Option of background subtraction for solution scattering based on 
WAXS intensity (water).
7. Flat field correction.
8. Correction for incident angle onto the detector.
9. Template proc.py and disp.py files in Example directory.

Summer 2012

1. added gui.py for solution scattering
2. updated handling of GID data in Data2D; added examples
3. revised conv_to_Iq to better deal with non-uniform q-grid, no longer
split intensity from one pixel into two bins in the I(q) histogram

Fall 2012

1. updated roi calculation and line profile extraction

Spring 2013

Updated slnXS.py to handle generic solution/powder scattering data
